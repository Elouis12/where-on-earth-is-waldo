ADDING 30 MINUTE INTERVAL FOR PASSWORD RESET REQUES

    1. add 2 entries to db for users
        * time requested
        * time for new request

        ex. if user requested a password reset at
            10 : 38


            TIME REQUESTED COLUMN

            get hours - 10
            get minutes - 48

            convert all to seconds

            hour 10 - 36000
            minute 30 - 1800

            add them

            total seconds 37800


            TIME FOR NEW REQUEST

            add 30 minutes or 1800 seconds

            so

            at  hour 11 we can make another request OR

            at 37800 + 1800 = 39600 seconds we can



           WHEN CHECKING DB

           TIME FOR NEW REQUEST - TIME REQUESTED

           if 39600 (11) - 37800 (10:30) >= 1800

           then let them



           OR CHECK IF TOKEN EXPIRED?

           IN DB REQUEST TOKEN set time for 30 minutes

           when clicking the rest button check db to see if it has expired
           this eliminated the issue if say the user made a reset password at 11:40 (42000) and time for new is 12:10 (43800)

           this causes problems in military and regular time

           if military time - when user makes request at hour 23 and 30 minutes later it is a new day at hour 0
           if regular time - when user makes request at hour 12 and 30 minutes later it is at hour 1

           both ways we have to make checks to see, so tokens would be better
